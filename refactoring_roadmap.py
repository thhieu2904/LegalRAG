Benefits after refactoring:
âœ… Main file: 400-500 lines (manageable)
âœ… Each service: 200-300 lines (easy to understand)
âœ… Better testing: Test each service independently
âœ… Better maintenance: Changes isolated to specific concerns
âœ… Better code review: Smaller, focused changes
âœ… Better onboarding: Easier to understand individual components
âœ… No performance impact: Same logic, better organization
